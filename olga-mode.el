;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the `adaptive-wrap-prefix-mode' minor mode which sets
;; the wrap-prefix property on the fly so that single-long-line paragraphs get
;; word-wrapped in a way similar to what you'd get with M-q using
;; adaptive-fill-mode, but without actually changing the buffer's text.

(provide 'olga-mode)
